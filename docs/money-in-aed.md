# Obtaining Money in AED

Dubai operates fairly heavily on cash and cards. Here are a few ways to obtain the local currency, AED.

Go to a physical currency exchange like Al Ghurair or Lulu Exchange with your passport and Emirates ID and handover foreign currency like USD, EUR, GBP, etc. in exchange for AED

Wise, Revolut, etc all work and you can always swipe a foreign card.
